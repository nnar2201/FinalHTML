<h2> Knowing about being physically torn</h2>
<div>
<p class="shark" id="sharks"> A muscle strain is the stretching or tearing of muscle fibers. Most muscle strains happen for one of two reasons: either the
  muscle has been stretched beyond its limits or it has been forced to contract too strongly. In mild cases, only a few muscle fibers
  are stretched or torn, and the muscle remains intact and strong. In severe cases, however, the strained muscle may be torn
  and unable to function properly. To help simplify diagnosis and treatment, doctors often classify muscle strains into three
 grades, depending on the severity of muscle fiber damage:</p>
<h3> The three grades of being physically torn</h3>
 <ul>
   <li>Grade I strain. In this mild strain, only a few muscle fibers are stretched or torn.
      Although the injured muscle is tender and painful, it has normal strength.</li>
      <li>Grade II strain. This is a moderate strain, with a greater number of injured fibers and more severe muscle pain and tenderness.
     There is also mild swelling, noticeable loss of strength and sometimes a bruise.</li>
   <li>Grade III strain. This strain tears the muscle all the way through, sometimes causing a "pop" sensation
    as the muscle rips into two separate pieces or shears away from its tendon. Grade III strains are serious
    injuries that cause complete loss of muscle function, as well as considerable pain, swelling,
    tenderness and discoloration. Because Grade III strains usually cause a sharp break in the normal outline of the
    muscle, there may be an obvious "dent" or "gap" under the skin where the ripped pieces of muscle have come apart.</li>
  </ul>
  <div>
  <h3> Symptoms of being physically torn</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Muscle pain and tenderness, especially after an activity that stretches or violently contracts the muscle
       -- Pain usually increases when you move the muscle but is relieved by rest.</li>
    <li>Muscle swelling, discoloration or both</li>
    <li>Muscle cramp or spasm</li>
    <li>Either a decrease in muscle strength or (in Grade III strains) a complete loss of muscle function</li>
    <li>A pop in the muscle at the time of injury</li>
    <li>A gap, dent or other defect in the normal outline of the muscle (in Grade III strain)</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<h3> Diagnosis </h3>
<p>Your doctor will want to know what type of activity triggered your muscle pain and whether
  there was a pop in the muscle at the time of injury. The doctor will ask about your symptoms, especially any
  decrease in muscle strength or any difficulty moving. Your doctor will want to know whether you've had recent fever, weight loss,
   leg numbness, urinary or bladder problems, or other symptoms that may point to a more severe medical problem.
After noting your symptoms and past medical history, your doctor will examine you, checking for muscle tenderness, spasm, weakness
 and decreased muscle movement. If this exam points to a mild or moderate muscle strain, you may not need any additional testing. However, if the diagnosis is in doubt, X-rays or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan may be helpful.
If you have back pain, your doctor may order additional tests to check for a urinary tract infection or a problem involving the
vertebrae (backbones), vertebral disks, spinal canal or spinal cord.</p>
